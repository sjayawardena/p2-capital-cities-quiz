(++add amiresponsive screenshots++)

Welcome! Capital Cities Quiz is a web-based, multiple choice quiz of world capital cities.

It is the second project for my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development, and utilises JavaScript operate the quiz game, as well as HTML. CSS styling is also applied.

The site is also responsive across all screen sizes.

The game is targeted at people who want to test their knowledge of capital cities, and is useful for this purpose.

It is also useful for those who want to test their capitals knowledge specificallly by difficulty level.

##Deployment

The site was set up by creating a new repository on GitHub, using this template from CodeInstitute.

The development environment used was GitPod. This was opened initially via the green 'GitPod' button that appeared on the repo's listing on GitHub.

The initial 'git add', 'git commit' and 'git push' were made on 17 September 2023. There have been over XX further commits since then.

The regular commits and pushes were sent from GitPod back to the repo on GitHub.

To deploy the live site from the GitHub repository, these steps as outlined on Code Institute's sample README file for the Love Running project were followed:

In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
